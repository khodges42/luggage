## Simple Dev Environments

This is just a pattern of dockerizing dev environments that I've been using recently. It allows for simple or complex development environments using make and docker-compose. I've gotten a lot of ideas and techniques from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtkHgQSSb3c
and shouts to https://github.com/krom/docker-compose-makefile for the makefile boilerplate.
